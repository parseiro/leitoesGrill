# Leit√µes Grill

This is a (theoretical) shop that sells ***special meats***.

The page is hosted on [Github Pages](https://parseiro.github.io/leitoesGrill/). The source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/parseiro/leitoesGrill).

This is a rework of [this masterpiece](https://deliciasdacarn8.wixsite.com/meusite/) (note: this is a real website from a meat shop in the city of Rio de Janeiro).
